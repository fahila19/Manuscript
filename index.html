<p>Alaxandra Lange, Critic </p>
<h1>CRITICISM = <span style ="color: rgb(239, 28, 63)">LOVE</span></h1>

<p> Open Letters is a print experiment that tests the epistolary form <br>as a device for generating conversations about architecture and <br>design. The publication was launched in September 2013 by<br> students at Harvard's Graduate School of Design. In preparation <br>for the February 14 GSD symposium, What criticism?, I wrote the<br>following letter to Tina Roth Eisenberg, a.k.a. swissmiss. It was published January 31.</p>

<p>Dear swissmiss:.</p>

<p>It may seem strange to be bothered by something published on the<br> internet in 2011. But I am, because that text remains the clearest <br>evocation of an attitude I continue to see on design blogs: that we <br>critics are motivated by hate. This is just plain wrong. Criticism = love.</p>
<P>On October 17 of that year you quoted your studiomate Chris Shiflett<br> under the heading, “Ignore haters”:</p>

<P>I always take more pleasure in liking something than in disliking <br>something. That is not to say there are not some things that deserve to<br> be liked and some things that deserved to be disliked, but I am never <br>fond of disliking something.</P>
    <P>The lesson I have learned is to be wary of those who are. The ones<br>
    who seem to think that being critical is the same as having good taste. <br>Those people almost never have good taste, so their opinions<br>
    dont matter.</P>

<P>There Is no particular sophistication required to be a critic. We know <br>this, because children often dislike foods they learn to love as adults.</P>
<P>As a child I disliked the Eames LCW chair in my parents bedroom.<br>
    I took no pleasure in hating it. My feeling separated me from my <br>mother, whose taste I have always admired. Was Eames a flavor I had <br>to become more sophisticated to enjoy? Perhaps. But that dislike, that<br> gap between us in taste, fueled a productive thought process. I had to <br>figure out what was so great about an object so ugly, so bulbous, so<br> unlike the other (normal) chairs in our house. I had to learn about the<br> Eameses, about bentwood, about cleaning up “the slum of legs.” If at <br>the end of that process I still hated the chair, would I have gained less <br>in sophistication? I learned to love the exploration. I love the chair <br>too, even though, due to its age and the innovative industrial means <br>of its manufacture, it is now sculpture rather than furniture.</P>
   
<P>All my life, criticism has been a gift. Literally. My mom gave me the<br> Eames chair a few years ago. I can wave at it from the desk at which<br> I am typing.</P>

<p>September, 2013</p>

<p>My now-husband's first gift to me was another collection of criticism, Michael Sorkins Exquisite Corpse. My education in criticism up to that date had been <br>establishment; this book was made of ruder stuff. It bristles with dislike about some of the very same buildings Ada Louise Huxtable loved, and love for <br>those about which she was lukewarm. The Ford Foundation. The Whitney. My favorite essay in the book is probably the one on the Whitney, an all-too-rare <br>love letter to Marcel Breuer intertwined with a demolition of Michael Graves and his “shitty beaux-arts apparatus.” However quotable, I still would not call <br>that hating. Sorkin says Graves can't help it, the apparatus is just his way. It’s on the rest of us to save the Whitney. Sorkin is simply giving us reasons why we <br>should. His conclusion is less important than explaining how to get there.</p>
<p>Your blog is clearly a critical enterprise. The mission of swissmiss seems obviously analogous to Tattly, which you created to clean up the slum of temporary <br> You must get hundreds of emails a day with products, apps, videos and posters that you deem unworthy of publication. Every time you dont <br>publish something, you are being a critic. Yet you dont share that judgment. That negative determination happens without comment, in the click of the <br>trash button. What I would like to hear about is what happens in your head between the look and that judgmental click. Why this and not that? Whats wrong<br> with that picture?</p>
    
<p>To be able to say, simply and directly, what is wrong (or not-yet-right) in design is not a childs task. I dont think it is possible to educate about design<br> without talking about the world of wrong, ugly, misguided and oversize. Yes, swissmiss, like Switzerland, might be the exception to that world. But it will <br>never be the rule, and accentuating the positive will only reorganize so much territory. Todays Lois Lane cannot avoid the aisles of the grocery store, the <br>app store, or Toys R Us. This Internet of Things: can it be without glitch? Skimming the cream off the top will always generate more clicks (anyone can <br>compare our Twitter followings), but there is more constructive work to be done below, where so many design blogs fear to dive.</p>
<p>You are motivated by a love of design, as am I. Haters are name-callers, body-shamers, trolls. They are destructive. If my fellow critics and I did not love <br>buildings, books, gadgets and food, there would be no reason for us to do what we do. I really dont get paid enough. But as I move through the world of <br>objects, I have a lot of questions. I cant ignore what I dislike or dont understand. Sometimes I describe the way I choose my topics as scratching an itch: if<br> something bothers me each time I see it, the only salve is investigation. Growing up is doing more than complaining (or, as you have said, coming up with a <br>Twitter hashtag). Let us talk about it—as adults, of course. I would like to save a building or improve a megaproject, but sometimes the critic has to settle for <br>creating a conversation.</p>
<p> Maybe this is just the long way of saying something very simple:</p>

 <h2>Dear Design. </h2>
 <h2>I love you.</h2>
 <h2>But love isn't blind.</h2>

 <h3>READING RESPONSE</h3>

 <p>This article approaches to design and the critical thinking one engages in during the design process in a very intriguing way. It is consistent with the idea of thinking passionately and strongly while allowing one's dislikes to achieve their objectives.</p>
   <p>User research and testing are at the heart of contemporary interaction design practice. And this interpretation effectively supports it by outlining how some things may work for a particular group of people while failing to do so for others. But the journey of getting there is always more significant than the outcome.</p>
   <p>Alexandra emphasizes the importance of having an opinion and the desire to like or dislike something in this article. Criticism should not be associated with hatred; rather, it fosters a sense of pleasure that fuels our productivity when sufficient thought is given to an object in order to fully comprehend its existence. "Negative determination happens without comment, in the click of the trash button. What I’d like to hear about is what happens in your head between the look and that judgmental click.”  As previously stated, not having an opinion/suggestion allows one's mind to take a break from constructive criticism and thoughts — it is critical to question, think, and re-evaluate the world of objects around us.</p>
    
   <p>What I disagree with about this reading is Alexandra's statement, “Haters are name-callers, body-shamers, trolls. They are destructive”. I believe that sometimes it makes sense for haters to pass comments in particular ways, because as designers, those comments could open doors to opportunities we are unaware of.</p>
    
   <p>Sometimes it is necessary to dislike what you like because it aids in the productive thought process. To achieve an innovative response, it is necessary to look at and perceive things from various perspectives. If you feel something isn't working out during the process, don't throw it away. Consider it in a wide range of ways until it makes sense. “Do not ignore what you dislike or don’t understand”.</p>
